# Local-Feature-Matching
*Local Feature Matching: Computer Vision University Project*

This project aims at learning to generate image features around a local point in the image. 

The project consists of three parts in `student.py`:

1. Generating Interest Points with Harris `get_interest_points`
2. Generating SIFT-like features around each interest point `get_features`
3. Matching Features between two images `match_features`
